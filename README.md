## System Overview

### **What is Alpha Points?**

Alpha Points is a comprehensive blockchain-based rewards protocol built on Sui, enabling partners to create sustainable reward mechanisms through TVL-backed quotas, automated revenue sharing, and dynamic growth loops.

### **Key Features**

#### **üè¶ TVL-Backed Partner System**
- Partners deposit SUI/USDC as collateral
- Receive minting quotas based on Total Value Locked (TVL)
- Daily throttling: 3% of TVL value per day maximum
- Lifetime limits: 1,000 points per USDC of collateral

#### **üí∞ Revenue Sharing (70/20/10)**
- **70% Producer Share**: Direct payment to perk creators
- **20% TVL Reinvestment**: Automatic growth of partner TVL
- **10% Platform Fee**: Protocol operations and development

#### **üîÑ Sustainable Growth Loop**
Revenue from perk sales automatically reinvests in partner TVL, creating a positive feedback loop that expands quota capacity over time.

#### **‚ö° Zero-Dev Integration**
Drop-in JavaScript SDK for automatic event detection and point minting with comprehensive rate limiting and abuse protection.

#### **üîí Collateralized Lending**
Users can borrow Alpha Points against staked SUI positions with 70% LTV ratio and partner attribution for fees.

### **Architecture Highlights**

#### **Three-Tier Architecture**
1. **High-Level**: Client applications, blockchain infrastructure, external services
2. **Mid-Level**: Frontend systems, partner systems, smart contract layers
3. **Low-Level**: Detailed components, hooks, contract specifics, transaction flows

#### **Modern Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Blockchain**: Sui Move smart contracts (2024.alpha edition)
- **Integration**: @mysten/sui SDK v1.30.1
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI
- **State Management**: React Query + Context API

#### **Smart Contract Modules (Active V2/V3)**
- `admin_v2.move`: Protocol governance with multi-sig and timelock controls
- `ledger_v2.move`: Fixed point accounting with proper APY calculations
- `partner_v3.move`: USDC-backed partner vaults with DeFi integration
- `generation_manager_v2.move`: Partner action registration and quota management
- `perk_manager_v2.move`: Points redemption marketplace with USDC payouts
- `oracle_v2.move`: Multi-source price feeds (Pyth + CoinGecko)
- `integration_v2.move`: User-facing entry points and safety checks

### **Economic Model**

#### **Value Alignment**
- **Users**: Earn points through staking, activities, and engagement
- **Partners**: Generate revenue through perk creation and TVL growth
- **Protocol**: Sustainable tokenomics with built-in growth mechanisms

#### **Risk Management**
- Collateral protection with appropriate LTV ratios
- Daily throttling prevents rapid dilution
- Oracle security with price feed validation
- Emergency controls and pause mechanisms

### **Implementation Status**

#### **‚úÖ Production Ready**
- Core ledger and balance management
- Partner onboarding and quota systems
- Perk creation and claiming mechanisms
- Revenue distribution and TVL growth
- Oracle integration and price feeds

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues**
- **Math Error**: Staking rewards giving 223x more points than intended (cannot fix due to Sui Move upgrade constraints)
- **Placeholder Features**: Loan interest (0%), NFT collateral (planned), hedge system (in development)

#### **üîÑ Active Development**
- Enhanced analytics and monitoring
- Volatility hedge system
- Advanced partner features
- Governance and compliance tools
